- make an index of available command line tools
	All:
	- imagemagick? *
	png:
	- optipng * (better version of pngcrush)
	- pngnq *  (lossy, better version of pngquant)
	- pngout http://www.jonof.id.au/kenutils
	- pngcrush *

	- gifsicle * (maybe)
* = available in ubuntu

trimage: simple gui for:
optipng for png and gif, jpegoptim for jpeg. both are available in ubuntu as dependencies (our primary platform)
^ no gif. optipng optimized gif by converting to png

==========================================
todo app wise
- implement something for gifs (or not)
- implement drag and drop on table
- clean up code, make it PEP-8
- figure out what to do with:
    - recompress and optipng ( âˆ’o7? ) not really doing anything
    - lockup when opening files (i'd like it to not lock up the file dialog)

todo else
- figure out dependencies for a .deb/how to make a .deb
- figure out launchpad repo or something
- figure out how to make mac and win versions

current dependencies:
python
python-qt4
hurry.filesize (bundled)

optipng
jpgegoptim
