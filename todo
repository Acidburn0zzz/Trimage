==========================================
todo app wise
- get rid of globals
- general refactoring
- use multiprocessing lib to take advantage of multicore/multi-CPU to compress
    multiple files simultaneously (threads have issues in Python; see "GIL")

todo else
- figure out dependencies for a .deb/how to make a .deb <- via launchpad
- figure out how to make mac and win versions (someone else :)

current dependencies:
python 2.6
python-qt4 4.4
hurry.filesize (bundled)

optipng 0.6.2.1
jpgegoptim 1.2.2
advancecomp 1.15
===========================================
later versions:
    animate compressing.gif
    allow selection/deletion of rows from table (and subsequently the imagelist)
    check for double files when adding
    punypng api? http://www.gracepointafterfive.com/punypng/api
    imagemagick/graphicsmagick?
    always on top option
