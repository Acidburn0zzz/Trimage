Description: GUI and command-line interface to optimize image files
 Trimage is a cross-platform GUI and command-line interface to optimize image
 files via optipng, advpng and jpegoptim, depending on the filetype (currently,
 PNG and JPG files are supported). It was inspired by imageoptim. All image
 files are losslessy compressed on the highest available compression levels.
 Trimage gives you various input functions to fit your own workflow: A regular
 file dialog, dragging and dropping and various command line options.
